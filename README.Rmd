<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CAISOtrends is to nicely wrap some functions for exploring trends in the CAISO energy trading network.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CAISOtrends from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("kbodwin/CAISOtrends")
```

## Example

For example, you can plot the real-time and day-ahead market rates of electricity in CAISO over a specified time period.

```{r example}
library(CAISOtrends)

plot_rtm(
  start_date = "2024-01-01",
  end_date = "2024-02-01",
  interactive = FALSE
  )
```

## Data Sources:

**Data is currently available pre-loaded for the 2024 calendar year, except for the large weather dataset, which can be loaded with `load_weather_data()`**

Supporting functions to collect and process data can be found [here](https://github.com/TheAllenChoi/energy_shenanigans/tree/main/data_collecting).

Full data used is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allenychoi/energy-market-data)

#### Data Sources:

* Interchange data was retrieved from [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/balancing_authority/CISO). Both halves of 2024 were downloaded from the EIA and merged using the `interchange_data_set.qmd` script.

* DAM/RTM data was retrieved from [OASIS](https://oasis.caiso.com/mrioasis/logon.do). Data was downloaded through the OASIS API by running `RTM_AND_DAM_DATA_GET.qmd` script.

* Outage data was from [CAISO](https://www.caiso.com/library/curtailed-and-non-operational-generator-reports).  Downloaded all the daily Prior Trade Reports for the targeted time period. Merged into a single CSV file using `combineOutages.py` script, which assumes a directory for each month.

* Power Plant Locations from [CEC](https://cecgis-caenergy.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/california-power-plants/explore?filters=eyJSZXRpcmVkX1BsYW50IjpbMCwwXX0%3D&location=37.106048%2C-116.331096%2C6.80). Data should be filtered to non-retired power plants. Make sure to click **Toggle Filters** when downloading. Merged with weather data using `getWeather.py` script.

* Weather Data from [FastHerbie](https://herbie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/tutorial/fast.html) and [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api?start_date=2024-02-02&end_date=2024-02-02&latitude=35.2956286090001&temperature_unit=fahrenheit&longitude=-119.592197855#hourly_weather_variables)
